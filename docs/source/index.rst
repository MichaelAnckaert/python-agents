Welcome to python-agents documentation!
=========================================

**python-agents** is an easy to use and powerful AI Agent development framework that implements the REACT (Reasoning and Acting) pattern for building agents with tool-calling capabilities.

The library provides a minimal but powerful abstraction for creating agents that can reason step-by-step and use tools to accomplish complex tasks.
